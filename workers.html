<h1 div="center" >The Current Economics System & Stress Management</h1>
<h2 text-align:center; >
The problem has to do with the current economics system. 
It is simply not sufficient for the level of care we are expected to receive.
The stress that the working class is under us so massive that we are doomed to collapse.
</h2>
<h1 >Why?</h1>
<h2  >
People's lives seem to revolve around how much money they make. The amount of money someone makes defines what kind of lifestyle they are going to have. 
If their lifestyle is based on a tight budget and they are always struggling to get by, then it’s going to be difficult to maintain a positive mental health state.
</h2>
<h1 >How is this a problem?</h1>
<h2 >

The amount of money that people make is simply not as much as people used to make 20 to 30 years ago, due to both inflation in prices but a decreased inflation in wages. 
The way you paid for college 30 years ago was to have a part time job flipping burgers and then you didn’t even have to worry about student loans. 
But the problem can’t be solved by just changing the minimum wage. The system needs to be changed at a fundamental level in order to help secure our future.
</h2>
<h1 >What can we do to fix this?</h1>
<h2 >

Everyone needs to push bills and changes towards congress through lobbying, political movements, and voicing support for those willing to overtake massive changes to the economic system.
Audience members can assist through providing resources to aid in the changes of the economic system or through experimentation.

In the United States, additional income from productivity and growth has been going mostly to those at the top of the income and wealth ladder. 
Between 1979 and 2016, the US national income grew by nearly 60%, but after accounting for taxes and transfers, the bottom half of the income distribution experienced incomes rising by 22%, while those in the top 10% had income gains that were almost five times as much – 100%.
</h2>
<h1 >What does this mean?</h1>
<h2 >
The income inequality is forcing a greater and greater gap that becomes more and more difficult to cross, and yet it is not addressed as well as it should be.

<h2>
Having a job doesn’t exempt anyone from poverty anymore. About 12% of Americans (43 million) are considered poor, and yet they are employed. They earn an individual income below $12,140 per year, and slightly more than that for a family of two.
If you include housing and medical expenses in the calculation, it raises the percentage of Americans living in poverty to 14%. That’s 45 million people.
</h2>
<h1> What's the problem?</h1>
<h2>
This should not be a thing. Poverty shouldn’t still exist even when you have a source of income. The “solution” to poverty is still allowing poverty to exist in our world.

</h1>
<h2>
Wages trend up but still too low: The tight labor market is no doubt lifting workers’ wages, particularly at the bottom of the wage scale as less-advantaged workers see their bargaining position improved.
However, a few good years of rising wages doesn’t make up for the decades of real wage stagnation faced by many middle- and low-wage workers.
The result is that for many working families, their paychecks fail to meet their basic needs.
</h2>
<h1> The Result </h1>
<h2>
Exactly as described in the earlier section, wage stagnation is a massive problem in how it relates to the buying power the average worker holds. 
The stagnation of wages means that they are forced to take on more work and more stress as a result.
</h2>
<h1> Overall...</h1>
<h2>

With such a minor focus on raising wages for the middle and lower classes, many people are having a harder time trying to just survive. 
The data proves that people who are already receiving a lot of money are only receiving more whereas everyone else below them have only seen small financial improvements.
 This wage inequality is causing a massive lifestyle difference between the classes; this makes it harder and harder for the gap between them to be bridged. On top of that, with the gap as large as it is, people recognize that life is not as pleasant as it could be if they had just a little more money.
 On the other hand, having too much money, as addressed in Lottery by Patricia Wood, is not the solution to life’s happiness either. Yet people still think is is and therefore strive to get more and more. Both spectrums on the scale of money making connect to being a mental health issue because people have to know how to manage it and still live a life knowing who is after them for their money and who likes them for them.
 This can be very stressful for people to handle and some people end up regressing into a state that could be classified as a mental illness.
